## **Migration Guide**

### **From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0**

This is a complete rewrite. Migration steps:

1. **Backup Data**: Export any existing conversations or configurations
2. **Environment Setup**: Create `.env` file with required variables
3. **Dependencies**: Install new requirements using `./setup.sh`
4. **Configuration**: Update configuration files for new architecture
5. **Testing**: Verify functionality with new test suite

### **Breaking Changes**
- Complete API redesign - all endpoints changed
- New configuration format - environment-based setup required
- UI completely rewritten - new component structure
- Database schema changes - migration required for existing data

### **New Requirements**
- Python 3.8+ (previously 3.6+)
- Node.js 18+ for frontend development
- Redis for caching and rate limiting (optional but recommended)
- Environment variable configuration
